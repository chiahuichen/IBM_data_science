## ibm_db_API.py
ibm_db_API.py connects to IBM DB2 cloud using Python Database API. The process involves creating a connection object, using the connection object to pass various queries, and retrieving result sets. Another method to access the database from the Jupyter notebook is by loading Jupyter extensions, SQL, and ibm_db_sa. In this method, there are fewer codes required to retrieve result sets. Another benefit is that it is easier to save the result sets to variables and convert them into Pandas dataframes. From there, plotting the result is just a few lines of code away.
